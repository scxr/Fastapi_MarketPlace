# Fastapi_MarketPlace
Attempting to make a crypto marketplace with fastapi and jinja2. Maybe ill change the jinja2 to chameleon or Angular (ts) if i somehow become less lazy and stop copying everything from freefrontend.com kekw. Unlikely but still, wont be using any JS on the frontend because noscript is a useful thing. 

Crypto based using the simple as fuck BIT module, cos i cant be fucked writing my own module to interact with my core node.
